We make a python application with flask, we use flask to create a web application that acts as a backend service, that uses an external api for model's prediction. 
We make api calls to specific url that host the api of model in order to use it.
Implementing this method, model's capabilities are reachable from different
frontend users (web apps, mobile apps). 
Of course in case of deployment on a cloud service so it being expose via a public url and it being accessible over the internet.

docker compose logic:
in docker compose with containers in the same network the communication between them achieved with internal dns 
names of services
so we use dockers compose internal dns name (api) for api service in order to connect to it and send
requests from app container 
we dont use localhost that refer to localhost of container
from outside world we can send a request (with postman) in http://localhost:5001/api_prediction

how to run it :

1) do build the base image that has the requirements run docker build -t base-image:latest . 
2) docker compose up to build the multi container app
